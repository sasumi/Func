# PHP Enhancement Functions Library
Common PHP function library, some functions of this library depend on PHP extensions, if the use environment does not need to use these functions, you can manually ignore them.
The list of dependent extensions is as follows:
- mbstring string processing function

- curl network request library
- pdo DB operation function, other functions basically do not depend on this extension
